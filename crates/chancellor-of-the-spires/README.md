# Chancellor of the Spires

A rules engine for Magic. So far it answers one question: **what is each
object on the battlefield right now**, through the layer system (CR 613),
with counters. Nothing plays a game yet.

[docs/research/rules-engine.md](../../docs/research/rules-engine.md) is the
plan, and [ADR-0037](../../docs/adr/0037-chancellor-lowers-insights-trees-into-its-own-effects-and-applies-them-layer-by-layer.md)
the seam:

- The game is a typed Rust state machine. `model::State` is the battlefield
  it will hold: objects with their printed characteristics and timestamps,
  counters, attachments, static abilities, and the continuous effects
  resolved spells left with the set each affects fixed (CR 611.2c).
- A continuous effect is the engine's own `Op`, one per layer, and the
  variant is the layer. Insight's trees will be lowered into these; today
  the tests build them by hand.
- `characteristics(&State)` applies them. Rust walks the layers in CR
  613.1's order and applies one effect at a time (CR 613.8c); before each,
  an ascent program picks which: dependency (CR 613.8a), loops (CR 613.8b)
  and timestamps (CR 613.7). An effect that started keeps its set through
  later layers, even when its ability is removed (CR 613.6).
- It builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so Meldweb Curator can carry it;
  natively ascent's `par` is on.

## What it covers

Layers 4 (adding types and subtypes, setting a basic land type, CR 305.7),
5 (colour), 6 (granting, removing, removing all) and 7b–7d (setting,
modifying, switching), counters in 7c, filters over type, supertype,
subtype, colour, controller, "other", "this" and "enchanted".
`tests/layers.rs` is the evidence: CR 613.4d, 613.5, 613.6 and 613.9's
worked examples, and Glorious Anthem with counters, Giant Growth under
Humility, CR 611.2c's fixed set, Blood Moon with Urborg and Humility with
Opalescence in both timestamp orders, against their Gatherer rulings.

Not yet: layers 1–3 (copy, control, text), 7a (characteristic-defining
abilities, and so CDAs first, CR 613.3), dependency through "what it does"
(CR 613.8a), counters' own timestamps (CR 613.7c), abilities granted with a
later timestamp (CR 613.7a), effects on players and rules (CR 613.10–11),
and any lowering from Insight.

## Speed

On the research's game-scale board (300 objects; two layer 4 effects, 14
setters and 14 anthems), one from-scratch run takes **1.1 ms** natively
(release, `timing_on_the_research_board`, ignored by default). The research's
toy took 0.34–0.51 ms but never re-decided its order after each effect.
Layer 7 skips the dependency check, since nothing a filter reads changes
there; without that the same board took 53 ms. Not measured in wasm yet.
